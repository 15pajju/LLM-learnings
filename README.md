# 🤖 RAG Chatbot with Streamlit, ChromaDB & Llama3

A local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. This project uses **Streamlit** for the frontend, **ChromaDB** for document storage and retrieval, and **Llama3** (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) for generating answers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload and analyze PDF documents
- 🔍 Ask questions based on uploaded content
- 🧠 Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch relevant answers
- 🤖 LLM responses powered by Ollama's Llama3
- 🎯 Supports multiple embedding models (`nomic`, `chroma`)
- 💬 ChatGPT-style interface using Streamlit
- 🌑 Dark-themed, centered, and responsive layout

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-chatbot.git
cd rag-chatbot

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
### 3. Install Python Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Set Up Ollama and Llama3
Install Ollama from: https://ollama.com

Then download and run the Llama3 model:


ollama run llama3
Make sure Ollama stays running in the background.

### 5. Run the App

streamlit run rag_app.py
### 🧠 How It Works
Choose an embedding model (nomic, chroma, etc.)

Upload a PDF document

The app:

Extracts and chunks text from the PDF

Creates embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB

Ask a question:

Relevant text chunks are retrieved using vector similarity

Passed along with your question to Llama3

The AI responds in a conversational format
